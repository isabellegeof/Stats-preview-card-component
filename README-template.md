## My process

Trial and error and cheating a little by looking at other people's code.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- You can creat something ressembling tables using divs (for the stats part of the card)! I found those easier to manipulate.
- To add color to an image, you can simply add a color background and reduce the opacity of the image.


### Continued development

- How to create pages that will be adapted to both desktop and mobile use.
- Positioning elements on the screen.


### Useful resources

Looking at other people's code when I was stuck!
